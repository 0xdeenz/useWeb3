Web3 is about the next evolution of the web. A web that is more open, transparent and permissionless and runs on decentralized infrastructure such as blockchains. Global and decentralized applications (DApps) that anyone can interact with. They often have native assets integrated (such as Ether) to transact value, but are not just about money or payments. These decentralized applications offer a range of digitial services, such as storage, bandwidth and computation without any risk of downtime, censorship, fraud, or 3rd-party interference.

## Benefits

**Open** - in that they are built from open-source software, by an open and accessible community of developers and executed in full view of the world. 

**Trustless** - in that the network itself allows participants to interact publicly, or privately without a trusted third party

**Permissionless** - in that anyone, both users and suppliers, can participate without authorisation from a governing body


## Opportunities

- Financial Tools (payments, fund raising, lending, borrowing,..)
- Identity solutions (self-sovereign, decentralized identifiers,..) 
- More secure voting and governance mechanisms
- Efficient resources management (CO2 tracking, smart grid’s,..)
- Digital ownership registries (e.g. land, collectibles, NFT’s,..)
- Supply chain tracking

# 3. Ethereum Development 


Once you've gone through all (or at least most) of the above, you should have a solid grasp of all the concepts. So now we can finally move on to the fun part: actually building stuff! 

To get a full, comprehensive overview of the Ethereum development landscape, check out:
- [Ethereum Developers](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/)
- [The full ConsenSys developer tool list](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list)

The Ethereum portal covers sections per programming language, to help you filter out what's relevant for you. Though JavaScript is most commonly used, I'd start with something that you're already familiar with, to flatten the learning curve. Use the above only for future reference. As mentioned previously, I'm trying to keep it simple and offer a few recommended options, from my own experiences. Feel free to discover, try, and learn everything from the developer portals, once you've covered these.

## Courses
