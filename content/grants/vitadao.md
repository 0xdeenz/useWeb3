VitaDAO is a community owned collective funding early stage longevity research

We discover and fund the most promising longevity research. We are funding early stage research, and try to turn it into biotech companies. Members can join VitaDAO by purchasing VITA tokens  or earning them through contributions of work or Intellectual Property.
