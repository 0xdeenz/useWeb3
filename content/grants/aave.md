Aave Grants DAO is a community-led grants program to fund ideas submitted by the Aave protocolâ€™s community, with a focus on empowering a wider network of community developers. The community has allocated $1 million per quarter for two quarters for funding grants. The program will run from May 10 to November 10. The grants program was created after a community discussion, which can be found on Aave's governance forum here.
