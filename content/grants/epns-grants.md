To bring more projects, ideas and developers to grow the EPNS ecosystem even faster.

Who can apply for grants (not limited to):

The grants are open for beginners and experienced people. Whatever your level of familiarity with development, we'll start the conversation in order to try to help and find ways to grow your contribution over time. ðŸš€
