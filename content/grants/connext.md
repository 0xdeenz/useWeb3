üöÄ Mission

At Connext, we believe that grants are one of the best ways to drive community ownership and action around public goods. Our goals with this program are to:

1. Foster the **development** of the Connext ecosystem through targeted resource allocation.
2. Give independent projects and working groups **ownership** of key parts of Connext.
3. Provide teams with **ongoing support** as they continue to build with Connext.

# üîç What We Look For

The best projects and teams:

- Meaningfully improve Connext in some way.
- Are passionate about our technology and community.
- Have a proven track record of producing high quality outputs.
- Embody Connext's values and ethos more broadly.
- Have a path to long term financial sustainability.
