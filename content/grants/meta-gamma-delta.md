Our vision is a world in which all people have economic freedom and financial independence. No matter the color of their skin, gender, sexual orientation, or the country they live in, everyone should have the right to live a happy and meaningful life. This type of world requires breaking down conventional structures and pushing against the status quo. It is what blockchain technology and decentralization aim to do.
