Sign-In with Ethereum is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet.

Instead of submitting to "Big Login," users can now login using the same keys controlling their blockchain accounts--without an intermediary. This approach has the promise but not guarantee to rebalance power dynamics in favor of the user. With Sign-In with Ethereum, we open a path where large corporations can no longer strip a user's ability to access services nor spy on their actions.

Sign-In with Ethereum is an open standard for authentication developed entirely in the open, informed through public discourse with community members across dapps, apps, wallets, security firms, and far more. You can find all the meeting recordings and notes on login.xyz. This approach is a far cry from the closed development of proprietary identity systems found in tech giants or government vendors, rightfully protested by privacy and digital rights advocates.

In contrast, Sign-In with Ethereum (EIP-4361) defines an open creative commons (CC) signing format for Ethereum accounts to securely authenticate with any web-based services. It was built by the community with direct support from the Ethereum Foundation and ENS, with Spruce tapped to lead the charge late last year. I'm excited to discuss the significance of Sign-In with Ethereum, and how it is so much more than "Connect Wallet" for all builders in Web3.
